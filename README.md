# marvtf
Marvin's Batmud TF scripts

bat_status.tf - Sets up the "visual mode" status line with hp/sp/ep, skill/spell in use, and list of effects

bat_effects.tf - Populates the list of effects on the status line. Custom effects can be added in a similar way.

bat_prots.tf - Sets up a list of effects that can be checked and re-applied with one command.

ship.tf - Commands for ship navigation. Warning: undocumented, somewhat complicated, and fairly heavily tied to my specific ship.
